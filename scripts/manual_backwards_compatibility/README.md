## Scripts to run inference with published checkpoints

This folder provides a couple convenience scripts for running inference
locally with published checkpoints. The scripts will download the necessary checkpoint
and data from HuggingFace and do a short inference simulation. It is useful
when you want to locally run inference with a 'production' model, e.g. to
test backwards compatibility or any other reason.
