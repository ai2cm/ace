    #
    # Contribution from u
    #
    # The u component of the wind is aligned with the longitude lines,
    # so all of its contributions are to the x and y components of the wind.
    # At the prime meridian (which lies on the x axis), the u component points
    # parallel to the y-axis, so it contributes only to the y component of the
    # wind. As we move eastward, the u component points more and more in the
    # negative x direction, so it contributes more and more to the x component
    # of the wind. At the 90 degree east meridian, the u component points
    # parallel to the x-axis (in the negative direction).
    #
    # This influence on the x component is captured by multiplying the u component
    # by the negative sine of the longitude, which is zero at the prime meridian
    # and then becomes negative until reaching -1 at 90 degrees east.
    #
    # The influence on the y component is captured by multiplying the u component
    # by the cosine of the longitude, which is 1 at the prime meridian and then
    # decreases until reaching 0 at 90 degrees east.
    #
    # Contribution from v
    #
    # The v component of the wind is aligned with the latitude lines,
    # with no contribution to the horizontal at the equator and full contribution
    # at the poles. This is captured by multiplying the v component by the sine
    # of the latitude, which is 0 at the equator and 1 at the poles.
    #
    # The direction of the horizontal contribution is the vector pointing inwards
    # towards the axis of rotation of the Earth. At the prime meridian, this
    # is the negative x direction. At the 90 degree east meridian, this is the
    # negative y direction.
    #
    # This influence on the x component is captured by multiplying the v component
    # by the negative cosine of the longitude, which is 1 at the prime meridian
    # and then decreases until reaching 0 at 90 degrees east.
    #
    # The influence on the y component is captured by multiplying the v component
    # by the negative sine of the longitude, which is 0 at the prime meridian
    # and then decreases until reaching -1 at 90 degrees east.
    #
    # An exact derivation proving this effect is captured by sine and cosine
    # can be done graphically. Generally for these kinds of problems on a sphere
    # or circle it's always sine and cosine, and the question is which one and
    # whether it's positive or negative.

    # at the equator, and is entirely perpendicular at the poles, an effect that
    # is captured by multiplying the v component by the cosine of the latitude.
