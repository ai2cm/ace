![NVIDIA Modulus Overview](/Modulus_overview.png)

[NVIDIA Modulus](https://developer.nvidia.com/modulus) is a neural network training and inference platform that blends the power of physics in the form of governing partial differential equations (PDEs) with data to build high-fidelity, parameterized surrogate models with near-real-time latency. Whether youâ€™re looking to get started with AI-driven physics problems or designing digital twin models for complex non-linear, multi-physics systems, NVIDIA Modulus can support your work.

With NVIDIA Modulus, we aim to provide researchers and industry specialists, various tools that will help accelerate your development of such models for the scientific discipline of your need. Experienced users can start with exploring the Modulus APIs and building the models while beginners can use this User Guide as a portal to explore the possibilities of AI in the domain of scientific computation. The User Guide comes in with several examples that will help you jumpstart your development of AI driven models.
