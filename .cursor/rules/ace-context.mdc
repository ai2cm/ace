## Repository Context: ai2cm/ace

This is a Python machine learning project for atmospheric modeling (ACE - AI2 Climate Emulator).

### Key Conventions

- Code is in the `fme/` directory (ace, core, coupled, diffusion, downscaling modules)
- Tests follow pytest conventions
- Configuration uses YAML files in `configs/`
- The project uses PyTorch for ML components

### Common Commands

- Run all tests: `make test` or `pytest .`
- Run fast tests only: `make test_fast` or `pytest --fast .`
- Run very fast tests: `make test_very_fast` or `pytest --very-fast .`
- Run tests with coverage: `make test_cov`
- Create development environment: `make create_environment`
- Build Docker image: `make build_docker_image`

When available, use the `fme` conda development environment to run tests.
