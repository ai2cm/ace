When asked to re-review a pull request (e.g., "Re-review PR #742" or "Check if my comments were addressed on PR #742"):

## Context Detection

First, determine what context is available:

1. **Previous Review Context Available**: If the current conversation contains a previous PR review or re-review from the Assistant, note those findings to compare against new changes. Ignore any reviews of unrelated PRs.

2. **No Previous Context**: If no previous review context exists, you'll need to fetch all review information from GitHub.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Determine Starting Point

- **If a commit SHA is provided** (e.g., "from commit acf1793"): Use that as the starting point for reviewing new changes.
- **If no commit SHA is provided**: Ask the user for the commit SHA where the previous review ended, OR offer to review all changes since the last review comment timestamp.

### Step 2: Fetch PR Data Using GitHub MCP Tools

Use the GitHub MCP server to gather:

1. **PR metadata**: `pull_request_read` with method `get` for current PR state
2. **New commits**: `list_commits` filtered to commits after the starting point
3. **New changes**: `get_commit` for each new commit to see the diffs
4. **Review comments**: `pull_request_read` with method `get_review_comments` to get all review threads
5. **PR comments**: `pull_request_read` with method `get_comments` for general discussion
6. **Current diff**: `pull_request_read` with method `get_diff` if needed for full context

### Step 3: Analyze Review Comments

For each review comment thread:

1. **Identify the reviewer's concern**: What was the issue raised?
2. **Check if resolved**: Look for:
   - Code changes that address the concern
   - Author's reply explaining why no change is needed
   - Thread marked as resolved
3. **Categorize status**: Addressed, Partially Addressed, Unaddressed, or Dismissed

### Step 4: Compare Against Previous Assistant Review (if available)

If you have context from a previous review in this conversation:

1. Compare your previous findings against new changes
2. Check if issues you raised were addressed
3. Note any issues from your review that were NOT addressed in the PR review comments
4. **Ask the user** if they want to see unaddressed Assistant findings that weren't part of the formal PR review

## Output Format

### Re-review Summary

- PR number and title
- Commits reviewed: `<starting_sha>...<current_head_sha>`
- Number of new commits since last review

### New Changes Overview

- Files modified in new commits
- Brief summary of what changed

### Review Comments Status

#### Addressed Comments

| Comment | File/Line | How Addressed |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| ... | ... | Code change / Author explanation |

#### Unaddressed Comments

| Comment | File/Line | Status | Notes |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------|
| ... | ... | Needs attention / Waiting for response | ... |

### New Issues in Recent Changes (if any)

- Any new concerns introduced by the latest commits
- Follow the same severity categories as pr-review.mdc:
  - **Critical Issues** (Must Fix)
  - **Suggestions** (Should Consider)
  - **Minor/Nitpicks** (Optional)

### Previous Assistant Review Findings (if applicable)

If previous review context exists and some findings were not part of the PR review:

> **Note**: The following issues from the previous Assistant review were not addressed in the PR review comments. Would you like me to include these in the summary?
> - [List unaddressed Assistant findings]

### Outstanding Items Summary

Clear list of what still needs attention before the PR can be merged:

1. Unaddressed review comments (with links if possible)
2. New issues found in recent commits
3. Any blocking items

### Recommendation

- **Ready to merge**: All comments addressed, no blocking issues
- **Needs minor changes**: Non-blocking items remain
- **Needs revision**: Blocking issues still unresolved

## Tips

- When fetching review comments, pay attention to the `isResolved` and `isOutdated` fields
- Author replies that explain design decisions count as "addressed" even without code changes
- Be concise in the re-review - focus on delta from previous state
- If the PR has been significantly refactored, consider suggesting a fresh full review instead
